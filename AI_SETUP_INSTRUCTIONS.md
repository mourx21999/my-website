## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Your Free Hugging Face Account
1. **Visit:** [https://huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. **Click:** "Sign Up" (top right)
3. **Fill out:** Username, email, password
4. **Verify:** Check your email and click the verification link
5. **Complete:** Your profile setup

> **💡 Tip:** Use the same email you use for development - makes it easier to manage!

### Step 2: Generate Your API Token
1. **Go to:** [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. **Click:** "Create new token" (blue button)
3. **Configure your token:**
   - **Name:** `Image Generator API` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Type:** `Read` (this is sufficient for our needs)
   - **Expiration:** `No expiration` (recommended) or set a future date
4. **Click:** "Create token"
5. **Copy immediately:** The token looks like `hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

> **⚠️ Important:** You can only see this token once! Copy it now or you'll need to create a new one.

### Step 3: Add Token to Your Server
1. **Navigate to your project folder:** `/home/martinoliverroux/my-website/server/`
2. **Open the file:** `server/.env` (create it if it doesn't exist)
3. **Add this line:**
   ```bash
   HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
   *(Replace with your actual token)*
4. **Save the file**

> **📝 Example .env file:**
> ```bash
> # Hugging Face API Configuration
> HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=hf_abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456qrst7890
> PORT=5847
> ```

### Step 4: Restart Your Server
```bash
cd /home/martinoliverroux/my-website
./restart-backend.sh
```

**You should see:** `✅ Hugging Face token configured - AI generation enabled`

## 🎨 AI Models You'll Have Access To

Your setup includes multiple AI models that will be tried automatically:

| Model | Best For | Style |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Stable Diffusion v1.5** | General purpose, realistic images | Balanced realism/creativity |
| **Stable Diffusion v2.1** | Improved quality, better faces | Enhanced realism |
| **OpenJourney** | Artistic, stylized images | Creative, artistic flair |

**The system automatically:**
- ✅ Tries each model until one succeeds
- ✅ Falls back to photo search if all AI models are busy
- ✅ Shows you which model generated your image

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Still seeing Photo Search results?"

**Check your token:**
```bash
cd /home/martinoliverroux/my-website/server
cat .env
```
You should see: `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=hf_...`

**Common issues:**
- **Extra spaces:** Make sure no spaces around the `=`
- **Wrong file:** Make sure it's in `server/.env`, not root `.env`
- **Token format:** Should start with `hf_`

### ❌ "Server won't start?"

**Check for syntax errors:**
```bash
cd /home/martinoliverroux/my-website/server
node index.js
```

**Common fixes:**
- Remove any quotes around the token value
- Ensure no special characters in token (copy-paste exactly)
- Check file permissions: `chmod 644 .env`

### ❌ "Token not working?"

1. **Verify token permissions:** Go back to Hugging Face settings
2. **Check token status:** Make sure it's active (green dot)
3. **Try regenerating:** Create a new token if the old one doesn't work

### ❌ "AI generation slow or failing?"

This is normal! Free tier limitations include:
- **Rate limits:** ~10-20 requests per hour
- **Queue times:** 30-60 seconds when models are busy
- **Automatic fallback:** System uses photo search when AI is unavailable

---

### Free Tier (What You Get)

## 🚀 Advanced Configuration (Optional)

### Custom Model Selection

```javascript
const aiServices = [
  {
    name: 'Your Preferred Model',
    url: 'https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/your-model-name',
    body: { inputs: prompt, options: { wait_for_model: true } }
  }
];
```

### Environment Variables
Additional options for your `.env` file:
```bash
# Core settings
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here
PORT=5001

# Optional: Timeout settings

```
